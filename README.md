For milestone 4, refer to "demoCode" to see the full functionality put together. 
The stepper sub system can be found in "stepper motor code updated", and the servo motor sub system can be found in "newServoCode".
All other files are intermediate steps.

Files starting with Testcode Or Democode are iterations of our final code, mean to be used to track versions fo the changes we make throughout our testing process. 
Seperate component code are are seperate files named after each one of them. 

The completed code used during the showcase is called FINALCODE and codes the full functionality of the robot as one autonomous system.
